IoT-Enabled Smart Agriculture Monitoring System

Problem Statement:
Traditional irrigation systems waste water, energy, and manpower due to lack of real-time monitoring.
This project builds an IoT-based solution using ESP32 and sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature,
humidity, and light intensity. The system automates irrigation through relay-based control and visualizes
live data via MQTT dashboard — enabling efficient, data-driven farm management.
